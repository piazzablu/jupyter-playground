# jupyter-playground

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that provide examples for different use cases 

**What are Jupyter noetbooks?**

The [Jupyter Notebook documentation] says:
>The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components:
>
>**A web application:** a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich mediaoutput.
>
>**Notebook documents:** a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects. 

You can view, but not execute, the notebook files (.ipynb extension) directly here in Github or use the jupyter [nbviewer] \
You can also execute some of the notebooks in [binder]
